Have you ever needed a demo to show what something is like when there's lots of resources under management, 
but you don't want to mortgage your house to pay the resulting AWS bill?

Have I got a config for you!

Introducing... lots of lambdas! Truly the solution to every problem, including this one. Just set the 
Terraform variable `INSTANCE_COUNT` to how many functions you need, and watch as it creates that many for you. 
And given you only pay for lambda execution rather than creation it's all completely free.
